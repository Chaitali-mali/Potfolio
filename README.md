## 👩‍💻 About Me

# 👋 Hi, I'm Chaitali Mali

🎓 Final-year Computer Science Engineering student | 💻 Aspiring Data Analyst & ML Engineer

---

Hi! I’m **Chaitali Mali**, a final-year Computer Science engineering student with a strong passion for **data science**, **machine learning**, and **analytics**.

I specialize in turning raw data into actionable insights using tools like **Python, SQL, Excel**, and **Power BI**.

I’ve completed internships and personal projects where I applied machine learning algorithms to real-world problems such as **customer churn prediction** and **email spam detection**.

My recent internship at **CodeSoft** helped me build ML models that improved classification accuracy by up to **35%**.

I also developed a mobile Android app for item sales tracking using **Java/Kotlin** and **Firebase**, combining my interest in backend logic and user-friendly UI design.

I’m well-versed in libraries such as **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, and enjoy visualizing data to uncover trends and communicate insights clearly.

My approach is detail-oriented and analytical, and I enjoy solving complex problems both independently and collaboratively.

📚 With a CGPA of **8.13**, I’ve maintained strong academic performance while developing real-world skills.

In addition to technical expertise, I bring strong soft skills like **communication**, **problem-solving**, and a **growth mindset**.

I continuously explore new technologies and participate in coding & ML challenges on **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/mGlmTqRsNn/)** and **[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/chaitalimali902)** to stay sharp.

I’m currently seeking **entry-level roles** in **Data Analysis**, **Machine Learning**, or related domains where I can grow and contribute.

From **data cleaning** to **predictive modeling** and **dashboard creation**, I enjoy the full data science pipeline.

💡 I'm especially passionate about leveraging data in **healthcare**, **education**, and **social impact** sectors.

🤝 I value teamwork, curiosity, and lifelong learning.
